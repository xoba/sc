# storage combinators

playing around with storage combinators (weiher & hirschfeld). to get started
with an example, you could follow this recipe:
```
git clone git@github.com:xoba/sc.git
cd sc
export GOPATH=/tmp/gopath
go run src/main.go
```
or, to use this as a module in your own project, simply run:
```
go get github.com/xoba/sc
```
